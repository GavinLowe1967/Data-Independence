\section{Defining data independence}  

The following definition captures our main assumption about the CSP script.
%
\begin{definition}
\label{defn:data-independent}
A CSP script is \emph{data-independent} for~$t$ if
\begin{enumerate}
\item The only constants from~$t$ that appear are within the declaration
  of the instantiation of~$t$.

\item There are no equality or inequality tests over values built from~$t$.

\item\label{item:sync} When two processes synchronise on a channel built
  from~$t$, for each field from~$t$ in the corresponding events, at least one
  of the processes is willing to accept an arbitrary value.

\item\label{item:di-invariant} Every expression that produces a set is
  invariant (Definition~\ref{def:invariant}) for: (1) top-level declarations
  (which includes declarations used for channels and datatypes); (2) sets used
  in alphabets and synchronisation sets for parallel composition, the
  exception operator, and hiding.

\item\label{item:di-renaming} For each renaming $\rename{e_1 \lArrow e_1',
  \ldots, e_k \lArrow e_k' ~ \M\| stmts}$, for each~$i \in \set{1,\ldots,k}$,
  and for each identifier~$x$ that appears in $e_i$ and that depends on~$t$:
%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x$ is bound by a generator $x \,\M{<-}\, s_x$ in $stmts$, where $s_x$
    is invariant; 
    % and uses no identifier bound by an earlier generator;

  \item $x$ occurs at most once in~$e_i$; and

  \item $x$ is not used in any predicate in $stmts$, or in the set~$s$ used in
  any subsequent generator $pat \,\M{<-} s$.
  \end{itemize}

\item\label{item:indexing} For each use of the replicated parallel operators
  (replicated alphabetised parallel, replicated generalised parallel,
  replicated interleaving, and replicated link parallel), and for replicated
  sequential composition, the statements that generate the component processes
  make no use of~$t$. 


\item\label{item:built-in-functions} The script does not apply any of the
  following built-in functions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the set functions |card|, |diff|, |inter|, |Inter|, |member| and
      |seq|; or the subset relations |<=|, |<|, |>=| and |>|;

    \item the sequence function |elem|;

    \item the map function |mapToList|;

    \item the function |show|.
  \end{itemize}
  %%  \CSPM{member}, \CSPM{card}, \CSPM{inter}, \CSPM{diff}, \CSPM{seq},
  %% \CSPM{mapToList},
  \CSPM{mtransclose} or \CSPM{show} to a value built from~$t$.
  \framebox{\ldots -- as in functions section}. 

\item The script makes no use of any compression function.
  %% s \CSPM{deter},
  %% \CSPM{chase} or \CSPM{chase_nocache}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
