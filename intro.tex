\section{Introduction}

This note seeks an alternative characterisation of data independence.

We consider a \CSPm\ script that is data independent in a type~$t$, including
no equality tests on values of type~$t$.  We make these requirements more
precise below.

Let $P[t]$ be a family of processes parameterised by the type~$t$.  We
consider instantiating the type parameter by two concrete types~$T_1$ and
$T_2$; we write the resulting processes as $P[T_1]$ and $P[T_2]$.  Let $f: T_1
\fun T_2$ be a surjection.  Lift $f$ to events by pointwise application; and
then lift $f$ to traces by pointwise application.  We will prove the following
results, subject to reasonably mild restrictions on the use
of~$t$.\footnote{The notation $f\inverse \banana{X}$ represents the relational
inverse image of~$X$ under~$f$, i.e.~$\set{y \| f(y) \in X}$.}
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\traces(P[T_2]) & = & \set{f(tr) \| tr \in \traces(P[T_1])},
  \label{eqn:traces} \\
\failures(P[T_2]) & = &
  \set{(f(tr), X) \| (tr, f\inverse \banana{X}) \in \failures(P[T_1])},
  \label{eqn:failures} \\
\divergences(P[T_2]) & = & \set{f(tr) \| tr \in \divergences(P[T_1])}.
\label{eqn:fd}
\end{eqnarray}

%%%%%

We now discuss the restrictions we need to place on the usage of~$t$, and of
elements of~$t$, in order to obtain these results.  First, what can we do with
the type $t$ itself?  Figure~\ref{fig:t-allowed} gives some examples.  (We use
these definitions in examples below.)
\framebox{\ldots} 

\begin{definition}
We say that a set or type is \emph{built from~$t$} if
%
\begin{itemize}
\item It is $t$ itself;

\item It is declared as a \CSPM{datatype}, and one of the branches uses a set
  built from $t$;

\item It is defined using a set comprehension, and one of the generators is
  over a set built from~$t$;

\item It is defined as a productions set (\CSPM{\{\|...\|\}}) where the
extensions (i.e.~the missing fields)  are built from~$t$.
\end{itemize}
%
A channel is \emph{built from~$t$} if its type uses a type built from~$t$.
\end{definition}
 
%%%%%

\begin{figure}[th]
\begin{cspm}
datatype Option = Some.t | None
channel in : t
channel c1 : t . Z -- Z some other set, independent of t
channel c2 : t . t
channel c2o : t . Option
Y = {| in |}
T1 = { x.z | x <- t, z <- Z } -- Z some other set
\end{cspm}
\caption{Allowable uses of the data independent type $t$. \label{fig:t-allowed}}
\end{figure}

%%%%%

\begin{definition}
A value \emph{uses}~$t$ if:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is an element of~$t$;

\item It is a tuple $(v_1,\ldots,v_k)$ or dotted term $v_1.\ldots.v_k$ and at
least one of the components uses~$t$;

\item It is a set, sequence or mapping, and at least one of the elements
uses~$t$; 

\item \ldots
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

%%%%%

What can we do with a value~$v$ built from~$t$?  A process can: receive a
value over a channel and store it; nondeterministically choose a value and
store it; build a new value (possibly using stored values) and store it; or
send a stored value.  However, no operation can be performed on the value~$v$
that restricts the type of~$t$: in effect, $t$~is a free polymorphic type.

We do not allow the script to contain any constant from~$t$, other than within
the definition of the instantiation of~$t$.  \framebox{**} I
think it would be ok to allow constants as long as all instantiations contain
those constants, and we restrict to functions that are the identity on each
constant. 

Also not functions like \CSPM{seq} \framebox{\ldots}

We also do not allow any equality or inequality tests over values of type~$t$.
%
\begin{example}
Consider the process
\begin{cspm}
c?x -> c?y -> if x = y then a -> STOP else b -> STOP.
\end{cspm}
%% \[
%% c?x \then c?y \then \If x = y \Then a \then STOP \Else b \then STOP
%% \]
%
This does not satisfy equation~(\ref{eqn:traces}).  Let $v$ and~$v'$ be distinct
elements of~$T_1$; then $tr = \trace{c.v, c.v', b} \in traces(P[T_1])$.  But
consider $f: T_1 \fun T_2$ such that $f(v) = f(v') = w$; then the
corresponding trace $f(tr) = \trace{c.w, c.w, b}$ is not a trace of
$P[T_2]$.  
\end{example}
%
If remapping by~$f$ unifies two values, equality tests can affect
the path followed by a process. 

We allow external choices and nondeterministic choices to be indexed over a
set built from~$t$, for example~\CSPM{**|~| x <- t @ P(x)}.  However, we
do not allow other operators, such as parallel operators, to be indexed over a
set built from~$t$.  We allow arbitrary indexing over sets that are
independent of~$t$. 

When two processes synchronise on a channel built from~$t$, we require that,
for each field from~$t$ in the corresponding events, at least one of the
processes is willing to accept an arbitrary value whenever it is willing to
accept any value.  For example, we allow
\begin{cspm}
c!x -> STOP [| {|c|} |] c?y -> STOP.
\end{cspm}
%%\[
%% c!x \then STOP \parallel[\eset{c}] c?y \then STOP.
%% \]
However, we do not allow 
\begin{cspm}
c!x -> STOP [| {|c|} |] c!y -> STOP
\end{cspm}
%% \[
%% c!x \then STOP \parallel[\eset{c}] c!y \then STOP,
%% \]
for that corresponds to an equality test between~|x| and~|y|. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Restricting sets}

We need to place various restrictions upon how sets based on~$t$ are defined.
In particular, we will have to place restrictions on the use of set
comprehensions. 

We need to restrict the set of events hidden by the hiding operator.  
%
\begin{example}
Consider the following process.
\begin{cspm}
P = (in?x1 -> in?x2 -> c2.x1.x2 -> STOP) \ {c2.x.x | x <- t}
\end{cspm}
Let
\[
T_1 = \set{A,B}, \quad T_2 = \set{C}, \quad f(A) = f(B) =  C.
\]
Then $P[T_2]$ has trace $\seq{\M{in}.A, \M{in}.B, \M{c2}.A.B}$, but $P[T_1]$
doesn't have the corresponding trace $\seq{\M{in}.C, \M{in}.C, \M{c2}.C.C}$,
contrary to equation~(\ref{eqn:traces}), because the final event would be
hidden.  In effect, the definition of the set of hidden events introduces an
equality test between the two data values.
\end{example}

%%%%%

To avoid situations like this, we will require that in each hidden set defined
by a set comprehension $\{ e \| stmts\}$, each identifier $x$ that appears in
$e$ and that depends on~$t$ occurs at most once in~$e$.  This would ban the
expression \CSPM{\{c2.x.x \| x <- t\}} that caused problems above, because~|x|
appears twice in the term~|c2.x.x|.

Similar examples shows that we need to restrict, in the same way, the sets
used for alphabets or synchronisation sets in parallel compositions, and the
set of thrown events for the exception operator.

We need the same restrictions on the types of channels.  
%
\begin{example}
Consider the following.
\begin{cspm}
datatype PairB = Two.t.t.Bool
channel two : union({Two.x.x.true | x <- t}, {Two.x.y.false | x <- t, y <- t})
P = in?x -> in?y -> two.Two.x.y?b -> STOP
\end{cspm}
%
The definition of the type of the channel~|two| means that two identical data
values can be tagged with either |true| or |false|, but two different values
can be tagged only with~|true|\footnote{The use of the {\cspmfont PairB} type
and {\cspmfont Two} type constructor is necessary to meet FDR's requirements
that the alphabet of each channel is rectangular, i.e.~the cartesian product
of sets of complete values; they aren't otherwise important for this
example.}.  The $P$ processes do not satisfy equation~(\ref{eqn:failures}), in
general.  Let $T_1$, $T_2$ and~$f$ be as in the previous example.  Then
$P[T_1]$ has a failure
\[
(\trace{\M{in}.A, \M{in}.B},\; 
  \set{\M{two.Two}.x.y.\M{true} \| x \in \set{A,B}, y \in \set{A,B}}),
\]
because, after that trace, the ``|?b|'' ranges over $\set{\M{false}}$.  
However,  $P[T_2]$ does not have the corresponding failure
\[
(\trace{\M{in}.C, \M{in}.C},\; \set{\M{two.Two}.C.C.\M{true}}),
\]
because, after that trace, the ``|?b|'' ranges over $\set{\M{true,false}}$.
In effect, the declaration of the type of~|two| has introduced an implicit
equality test: the ``|?b|'' is equivalent to ``\CSPM{?b:(if x==y
then \{true,false\} else \{false\})}'', which would not be allowed because of
the equality test.
\end{example}

%%%%%

We avoid this problem by imposing the same restriction as for hiding: we do
not allow an identifier to appear twice in the term defining the events, which
bans the expression \CSPM{\{Two.x.x.true \| x <- t\}}.



%% For simplicity, we do not allow any set expressions using~$t$, other than
%% expressions of the form $\eset{c_1, \ldots, c_k}$ for channel
%% identifiers~$c_1, \ldots, c_k$, or of the form $\eset{C_1, \ldots, C_k}$ for
%% datatype constructors~$C_1, \ldots, C_k$.  \framebox{???}

%% \framebox{**} This could probably be weakened.  I think it would probably be
%% ok to restrict set comprehensions so that each name that is bound by a
%% generator over a set built from~$t$ is used at more once.  This would ban the
%% expression \CSPM{\{Two.x.x.true \| x <- t\}} that caused problems above.  It's
%% enough to ensure $T$-invariance. 
%% %
%% Note we also prevent such bound names appearing within the range of another
%% generator, to prevent expressions such as  
%% \CSPM{\{Two.x.y.true \| x <- t, y <- \{x\}\}}.

%% We  need to restrict operations over sets that are built from~$t$.  We
%% do allow sets to be built that contain values built from~$t$, and allow the
%% \CSPM{union} and \CSPM{empty} functions to be applied to such sets.  However,
%% we do not allow the function \CSPM{member} to be applied to a set built
%% from~$t$, because it can be used to simulate equality tests: the expression
%% $\CSPMM{member}(x, \set{y})$ is equivalent to $x = y$.  Likewise, we do not
%% allow the function \CSPM{card} to be applied to a set built from~$t$: the
%% expression $\CSPMM{card} \set{x,y} = 1$ is equivalent to $x = y$.  Similarly,
%% we do not allow pattern matching over sets built from~$t$ that are based on
%% the cardinality of the set.  We also do not allow the \CSPM{inter} and
%% \CSPM{diff} functions since (when combined with \CSPM{empty}) they can be used
%% to simulate equality tests.

%% We can build sets using comprehensions over sets based on~$t$, for example,
%% the set |T1| in Figure~\ref{fig:t-allowed}.  However, we cannot build
%% sequences in the same way.  An expression such as \CSPM{< x.3 \| x <- t >}
%% doesn't type check, since |t| is a set, not a sequence.  And, as noted above,
%% we cannot use the function |seq| to convert a set into a sequence.  


\begin{definition}
\label{def:invariant}
We say that a definition of a set is \emph{invariant} if it is of one of the
following forms:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item A definition that is independent of~$t$.

\item A set comprehension $\M\{ e \,\M\| stmts \M\}$ or a productions set
comprehension $\M{\{\|} e \,\M\| stmts \M{\|\}}$, such that for every identifier
$x$ that appears in $e$ and that depends on~$t$:
  % 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x$~is bound by a generator $x \,\M{<-}\, s_x$ in $stmts$, where $s_x$ is
  itself invariant: 
  % and uses no identifier bound by an earlier generator;
  \item $x$~occurs only once in~$e$; and
  \item $x$ is not used in any predicate in $stmts$, or in the set~$s$ used in
  any subsequent generator $pat \,\M{<-} s$ (whether or not $pat$ uses values of
  type~$t$). 
  \end{itemize}

\item The name of a datatype (including $t$). 

\item A name $x$ that is bound by a declaration $x = s$, where $s$ is itself
invariant. 

\item \CSPM{union(S1, S2)} where |S1| and |S2| are invariant forms. 

\item ......
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

For example, the set comprehension 
\begin{cspm}
{ c2o.x.sy | x <- t, sy <- {Some.y | y <- t} }
\end{cspm}
is invariant.

Note that the cases of a set comprehension or an extensions set comprehension
allow the statements $stmts$ to be empty, corresponding to a simple expression
$\M\{ e \M\}$ or $\M{\{\|} e \M{\|\}}$.

We included a restriction that the set of a generator doesn't use an earlier
bound variable.  This prevents expressions such as
\CSPM{\{c2.x.y \| x <- t, y <- \{x\}\}}, which would produce a set that we
want to disallow.

We need a similar restriction for renamings.  Consider
%
\begin{cspm}
channel d
P = (in?x -> in?y -> c2.x.y -> STOP)[[ c2.x.x <- d | x <- t ]]
\end{cspm}
%
Let $T_1$, $T_2$ and $f$ be as earlier.  Then $P[T_1]$ has trace
$\trace{\M{in}.A, \M{in}.B, \M{c2}.A.B}$.  But $P[T_2]$ does not have the
corresponding trace $\trace{\M{in}.C, \M{in}.C, \M{c2}.C.C}$.  We prevent
renamings such as ``\CSPM{c2.x.x <- d}'', which contains an implicit equality
test.  (We define the restriction as item~\ref{item:di-renaming} of
Definition~\ref{defn:data-independent}.) 

Perhaps surprisingly, we don't need a similar restriction for selective inputs
in prefixes.  For example we allow a prefixing construct such
as \CSPM{c2?pair:\{x.x \| x <- t\}}.  Indeed, that construct is equivalent
to \CSPM{c2?x!x}.  Of course, when used in a parallel composition, any
synchronising process would have to accept an arbitrary value for the second
field to prevent implicit equality tests in that process.
