\section{Main proposition}
\label{sec:proof}

%%%%%%%%%%

In this appendix, we prove Proposition~\ref{prop:expressions}, by induction
over the syntax of \CSPm.  The proof is split over the following subsections.
Several cases are as in~\cite{symmetry-TR}, but we include them for
completeness.

Recall that we assume $f: T_1 \fun T_2$, and the environment~$\rho$ is
$T_1$-invariant.
