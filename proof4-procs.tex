\subsubsection{Non-replicated sequential operators.}
\label{sec:sequential-procs}

We now consider non-replicated sequential operators.  

\paragraph{Binary sequential operators.}

We start with external choice.
%
Below we write $\extchoice$ for a semantic operator that takes two ALTSs and
forms an external choice over them.  
%% : ``${P \extchoice Q}$''
%% represents an external choice between~$P$ and~$Q$, each of which is an LTS\@.
So $\eval \rho~(P\; \M{[]} Q) = (\eval \rho~P) \extchoice (\eval \rho~Q)$,
where the first ``$\M{[]}$'' is the syntactic operator, and the second
$\extchoice$ is the semantic operator.  

By induction, we can assume that $\eval \rho~P \bisim_f \eval (f(\rho))~ P$,
and similarly for~$Q$.  We show that $\eval \rho~(P \;\M{[]} Q) \bisim_f \eval
(f(\rho))~ (P \;\M{[]} Q)$, following Definition~\ref{def:f-bisim}.  It
is enough to consider transitions up to the resolution of the choice.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a transition $(P\; \M{[]} Q, \rho) \trans{a}_{T_1}
(P', \rho')$ corresponding to a transition $(P, \rho) \trans{a}_{T_1}
(P',\rho')$ with $a \ne \tau$.  Then by induction, $(P,
f(\rho)) \trans{f(a)}_{T_2} (P', f(\rho'))$, and so $(P\; \M{[]} Q,
f(\rho)) \trans{f(a)}_{T_2} (P', f(\rho'))$.

The cases for transitions of~$Q$ and $\tau$-transitions are very similar. 

\item Consider a transition $(P\; \M{[]} Q, f(\rho)) \trans{b}_{T_2}
(P', \rho')$ corresponding to a transition $(P, f(\rho)) \trans{b}_{T_2}
(P', \rho')$ with $b \ne \tau$.  But then by induction, there is some $a$
and~$\rho''$ such that $(P, \rho) \trans{a}_{T_1} (P', \rho'')$ with $f(a) =
b$ (so $a \ne \tau$) and $f(\rho'') = \rho'$.  But then $(P\; \M{[]}
Q, \rho) \trans{a}_{T_1} (P', \rho'')$.

Again, the cases for transitions of~$Q$ and $\tau$-transitions are very
similar.
\end{enumerate}

%% Hence $f(\eval \rho ~ (P \; \M{[]} Q)) = \eval (f(\rho)) (P \; \M{[]} Q)$ by
%% Lemma~\ref{lem:ALTS-respects-f-implication}. 

%% We show that
%% %
%% \begin{eqnarray*}
%% f(P \extchoice Q) & = & f(P) \extchoice f(Q).
%% \end{eqnarray*}
%% %
%% For every transition $P \trans{e} P'$, the initial state of each of the above
%% processes has a transition labelled $f(e)$ to~$f(P')$; and similarly for
%% transitions of~$Q$.

%% We then have the following (for syntactic expressions~$P$ and~$Q$; in the
%% first and last lines, ``\CSPM{[]}'' is syntax; in other lines, it is the
%% semantic operator):
%% %
%% \begin{calc}
%% & f(\eval \rho ~ (P \; \M{[]} Q) \\
%% = & f((\eval \rho~P) \extchoice (\eval \rho~Q)) \\
%% = & \com{above result} \\
%% & f(\eval \rho~P) \extchoice f(\eval \rho~Q) \\
%% = & \com{inductive hypothesis} \\
%% & (\eval (f(\rho))~P) \extchoice (\eval (f(\rho))~Q) \\
%% = & \eval (f(\rho)) (P \; \M{[]} Q).
%% \end{calc}

%%%%%

The proofs for the binary operators nondeterministic choice (\CSPM{_ \|~\|
_}), sliding choice (\CSPM{_ [> _}), interrupt (\CSPM{_ /\\ _}), and
sequential composition (\CSPM{_ ; _}) are very similar.

%%%%%


For the exception operator (\CSPM{_ [\| E \|> _}), recall that we assume that
|E| is invariant (item~\ref{item:di-invariant} of
Definition~\ref{defn:data-independent}).  Hence $\eval \rho~E$ is
$T_1$-invariant, by Lemma~\ref{lem:invariant}, so $a \in \eval \rho~E \iff
f(a) \in f(\eval \rho~E) = \eval (f(\rho))~E$ by
Lemma~\ref{lem:T-invariant-inclusion}.

We assume, by induction, that $\eval \rho~P \bisim_f \eval (f(\rho))~P$, and
similarly for~$Q$.  We show that $\eval \rho~(P \throw{E} Q) \bisim_f \eval
(f(\rho)) (P \throw{E} Q)$.  It is enough to consider transitions up to the
resolution of the exception operator; we write $P'$ for the corresponding
state of~$P$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a transition $(P' \throw{E} Q, \rho) \trans{a}_{T_1}
(P'' \throw{E} Q, \rho')$ corresponding to a transition
$(P', \rho) \trans{a}_{T_1} (P'', \rho')$, with $a \nin \eval \rho~E$.  Then
by induction, $(P', f(\rho)) \trans{f(a)}_{T_2} (P'', f(\rho'))$.  Also,
$f(a) \nin f(\eval \rho~E)$, by $T_1$-invariance.  Hence $(P' \throw{E} Q,
f(\rho)) \trans{f(a)}_{T_2} (P'' \throw{E} Q, f(\rho'))$.

The case of $a \in \eval \rho~E$ is very similar: then $f(a) \in
f(\eval \rho~E)$, and both transitions of $P' \throw{E} Q$ produce~$Q$.

\item Consider a transition $(P' \throw{E} Q, f(\rho)) \trans{b}_{T_2}
(P'' \throw{E} Q, \rho')$ corresponding to a transition $(P',
f(\rho)) \trans{b}_{T_2} (P'', \rho')$, with $b \nin \eval (f(\rho))~E$.  Then
by induction, there is some~$a$ and $\rho''$ such that
$(P', \rho) \trans{a}_{T_1} (P'', \rho'')$ with $f(a) = b$ and $f(\rho'')
= \rho'$.  But then $a \nin \eval \rho~E$, by $T_1$-invariance.  Hence
$(P' \throw{E} Q, \rho) \trans{a}_{T_1} (P'' \throw{E} Q, \rho'')$.

The case of $b \in \eval (f(\rho))~E$ is again very similar.
\end{enumerate}


%% %  
%% We write $\_ \throw{A} \_$ for the corresponding semantic operator.  We show
%% that if $A$ is $T_1$-invariant then
%% \begin{eqnarray*}
%% f(P \throw{A} Q) & = & f(P) \throw{f(A)} f(Q).
%% \end{eqnarray*}
%% %
%% On the left-hand side, every transition of~$P$ on an event from~$A$ is replace
%% by a transition to the initial state of~$Q$, and then all events are renamed
%% by~$f$.  On the right-hand side, the events are renamed first, and then every
%% transition from $f(P)$ on an event from~$f(e) \in f(A)$ is replaced by a
%% transition to the initial state of~$f(Q)$.  But if $f(e) \in f(A)$ then $e \in
%% A$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:T-invariant-inclusion}, so there is a corresponding
%% transition on the left-hand side.  The rest of the proof is then as for
%% external choice.

\paragraph{Other sequential operators.} 

For hiding, note that if $A$ is $T_1$-invariant, then
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(P \hide A) & = & f(P) \hide f(A).
\end{eqnarray*}
%
On the right-hand side, an event $e$ of~$P$ is hidden if $f(e) \in f(A)$; but
then $e \in A$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:T-invariant-inclusion}, so the same event is
hidden on the left-hand side.  The rest of the proof is then as for external
choice.

The case for projection is almost identical to that for hiding. 

The result holds for structural operators (local declarations and |if|
statements) as in Section~\ref{sec:structural}.

A guarded process $g ~\M{\&}~ P$ is equivalent to $\M{if}~ g ~ \M{then}~
P ~ \M{else STOP}$.  The result follows from the result for |if| statements.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Binary Parallel operators.}
\label{sec:parallel}

We now consider the binary parallel operators.  We start with the generalised
parallel operator $\_ \synPar{e_A}  \_$\,.  

We write $\_ \parallel{A}^{e_A} \_$ for a semantic operator that forms the
parallel composition of LTSs, synchronising on events from~$A$, corresponding
to the syntactic expression~$e_A$.  Recall that we assume that the identifiers
bound by the two components of the parallel composition are disjoint; this
means that we can restrict a ``global'' environment to the identifiers of each
component, or form the union of the environments of the two components.  For
example, if in LTS~$L_P$ there is a transition $(P, \rho_P) \trans{e}
(P', \rho_P')$, and in LTS~$L_Q$ there is a transition $(Q, \rho_Q) \trans{e}
(Q', \rho_Q')$, with $e \in A$, and $\rho_P$ and~$\rho_Q$ agree on common
identifiers, then in LTS $L_P \parallel{A}^{e_A} L_Q$ there is a transition
$(P \synPar{e_A} Q, \rho_P \union \rho_Q) \trans{e} (P'
\synPar{e_A} Q', \rho_P' \union \rho_Q')$: the resulting environments
$\rho_P'$ and $\rho_Q'$ agree on common identifiers, so their union makes
sense.

Let $A = \eval \rho~e_A$.  So $\eval (f(\rho))~e_A = f(A)$, by induction.
Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eval \rho~ (P_1 \synPar{e_A} P_2) & = & 
  (\eval \rho~ P_1) \parallel{A}^{e_A} (\eval \rho~ P_2) , \\
\eval (f(\rho)) ~ (P_1 \synPar{e_A} P_2) & = & 
  (\eval (f(\rho))~ P_1) \parallel{f(A)}^{e_A} (\eval (f(\rho))~ P_2).
\end{eqnarray*}
%
Recall that we assume that $e_A$ is invariant, and hence $A$ $T_1$-invariant.

We can prove that $\eval \rho~ (P_1 \synPar{e_A} P_2) \bisim_f \eval (f(\rho))
~ (P_1 \synPar{e_A} P_2)$.  The tricky case is as follows.
%
Consider a transition, in the ALTS for $\eval (f(\rho)) ~ (P_1 \synPar{e_A}
P_2)$ corresponding to a synchronisation:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
(Q_1 \synPar{e_A} Q_2, f(\rho_1 \union \rho_2)) & \trans{b}_{T_2} &
  (Q_1' \synPar{e_A} Q_2', \rho_1' \union \rho_2')
\end{eqnarray*}
%
with $b \in f(A)$, corresponding to transitions in the ALTSs for $\eval
f(\rho)~ P_1$ and $\eval f(\rho)~ P_2$:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
(Q_1, f(\rho_1)) & \trans{b}_{T_2} & (Q_1', \rho_1') , \\
(Q_2, f(\rho_2)) & \trans{b}_{T_2} & (Q_2', \rho_2').
\end{eqnarray*}
%
By the inductive hypothesis, there are transitions in the ALTSs
for $\eval \rho~ P_1$ and $\eval \rho~ P_2$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
(Q_1, \rho_1) & \trans{a_1}_{T_1} & (Q_1', \rho_1'') , 
   \quad \mbox{with $f(a_1) = b$ and $f(\rho_1'') = \rho_1'$}, \\
(Q_2, \rho_2) & \trans{a_2}_{T_1} & (Q_2', \rho_2''),
   \quad \mbox{with $f(a_2) = b$ and $f(\rho_2'') = \rho_2'$}.
\end{eqnarray*}
%
%% with $f(a_1) = f(a_2) = b$,\, $f(\rho_1'') = \rho_1'$ and $f(\rho_2'')
%% = \rho_2'$. 
%
If $a_1 \ne a_2$, then consider the first field in which they differ; say $a_1
= c.\vec{u}.v_1.\vec{w_1}$ and $a_2 = c.\vec{u}.v_2.\vec{w_2}$ with $v_1 \ne
v_2$ but $f(v_1) = f(v_2)$.
%
Then by item~\ref{item:sync} of Definition~\ref{defn:data-independent}, one of
the processes must be willing to accept an arbitrary value in this position;
without loss of generality, suppose this is~$Q_1$, so $Q_1$ can also perform
$a_1' = c.\vec{u}.v_2.\vec{w_1}$.  If the transition binds $x$ to this field
in $Q_1$'s environment, then this corresponds to the transition
$(Q_1,\rho_1) \trans{a_1'} (Q_1',\rho_1''')$ where $\rho_1'''
= \rho_1'' \oplus \set{x \mapsto v_2}$.  Note that $f(a_1') = b$ and
$f(\rho_1''') = f(\rho_1'') = \rho_1'$.
%
Continuing in this way, we obtain transitions
\[
\begin{array}{c}
(Q_1,\rho_1) \trans{a'}_{T_1} (Q_1',\hat\rho_1) \quad\mbox{and}\quad
(Q_2,\rho_2) \trans{a'}_{T_1} (Q_2',\hat\rho_2) \\
\mbox{with}\quad f(a')  = b, \quad 
f(\hat\rho_1) = \rho_1', \quad f(\hat\rho_2) = \rho_2'.
\end{array}
\]
Also, $f(a') = b \in f(A)$, and $A$ is $T_1$-invariant, so $a' \in A$.  
Hence in the ALTS for $\eval \rho~ (P_1 \synPar{e_A} P_2)$, we have a
transition synchronising on~$a'$: 
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
(Q_1 \synPar{e_A} Q_2, \rho_1 \union \rho_2) & \trans{a'}_{T_1} &
  (Q_1' \synPar{e_A} Q_2', \hat\rho_1 \union \hat\rho_2),
\end{eqnarray*}
and $f(\hat\rho_1 \union \hat\rho_2) =  \rho_1' \union \rho_2'$, as required.

Other cases ---that every synchronisation of $\eval \rho~ (P_1 \synPar{e_A}
P_2)$ is matched by a synchronisation of $\eval (f(\rho)) ~ (P_1 \synPar{e_A}
P_2)$, and that non-synchronisation transitions match--- can be proved in a
similar but more straightforward way.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% \subsection{OLD}

%% We show that, assuming $A$ is $T_1$-invariant:
%% %
%% \begin{eqnarray}
%% \label{eqn:parallel-dist}
%% f((P,\rho_P) \parallel{A} (Q,\rho_Q)) & = & 
%%   f(P,\rho_P) \parallel{f(A)} f(Q,\rho_Q).
%% \end{eqnarray}
%% %
%% The tricky case is as follows.  Consider a transition of the right-hand side
%% corresponding to a synchronisation on event~$e \in f(A)$.  This must
%% correspond to transitions 
%% \[
%% (P,\rho_P) \trans{e_P} (P',\rho_P') \quad\mbox{and}\quad
%% (Q,\rho_Q) \trans{e_Q} (Q',\rho_Q') \quad
%% \mbox{with}\quad f(e_P) = f(e_Q) = e.
%% \]
%% The subsequent state is 
%% \[
%% f(P',\rho_P') \parallel{f(A)} f(Q',\rho_Q') = 
%%   (P',f(\rho_P')) \parallel{f(A)} (Q',f(\rho_Q')).
%% \]
%% If $e_P \ne e_Q$, then consider the first field in which they differ; say $e_p
%% = c.\vec{u}.v_P.\vec{w_P}$ and $e_Q = c.\vec{u}.v_Q.\vec{w_Q}$ with $v_P \ne
%% v_Q$ but $f(v_P) = f(v_Q)$.
%% %
%% Then by item~\ref{item:sync} of Definition~\ref{defn:data-independent}, one of
%% the processes must be willing to accept an arbitrary value in this position;
%% without loss of generality, suppose this is~$P$, so $P$ can also perform $e_P'
%% = c.\vec{u}.v_Q.\vec{w_P}$.  If the transition binds $x$ to this field in
%% $P$'s environment, then this corresponds to the transition
%% $(P,\rho_P) \trans{e_P'} (P,\rho_P'')$ where $\rho_P''
%% = \rho_P' \oplus \set{x \mapsto v_Q}$.  Note that $f(e_P') = e$ and
%% $f(\rho_P'') = f(\rho_P')$.
%% %
%% Continuing in this way, we obtain transitions
%% \[
%% \begin{array}{c}
%% (P,\rho_P) \trans{e'} (P',\hat\rho_P) \quad\mbox{and}\quad
%% (Q,\rho_Q) \trans{e'} (Q',\hat\rho_Q) \\
%% \mbox{with}\quad f(e')  = e, \quad 
%% f(\hat\rho_P) = f(\rho_P'), \quad f(\hat\rho_Q) = f(\rho_Q').
%% \end{array}
%% \]
%% Also, note that $f(e') = e \in f(A)$, so $e' \in A$, by
%% Lemma~\ref{lem:T-invariant-inclusion}, since $A$ is $T_1$-invariant.
%% %
%% Hence, in the left-hand side of (\ref{eqn:parallel-dist}), the two
%% components can synchronise on~$e'$, giving a transition on $f(e') = e$, and
%% producing state 
%% \[
%% f( (P',\hat\rho_P) \parallel{A} (Q',\hat\rho_Q) ) .
%% \]
%% This matches the original transition of the right-hand side.

%% Other cases ---that every synchronisation of the left-hand side is matched by
%% a synchronisation of the right-hand side, and that non-synchronisation
%% transitions match--- can be proved in a similar but more straightforward way.

%% The proof then proceeds as for other binary operators.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The cases of the alphabetised parallel 
($\M{[} A\, {\|\|}\, B \M{]} $),
interleaving (\CSPM{\|\|\|}), synchronising external choice
(\CSPM{[+}\,$A$\,\CSPM{+]}) and synchronising interrupt
(\CSPM{/+}\,A\,\CSPM{+\\}) operators are similar; recall that it is assumed
that the expressions that define the alphabets are invariant, and hence the
values of those alphabets are $T_1$-invariant.

The case of  link parallel follows from earlier cases, since any instance can
be rewritten using a combination of renaming, generalised parallel, and
hiding: the conditions placed on use of link parallel
(clause~\ref{item:di-renaming} of Definition~\ref{defn:data-independent}) are
enough to imply the requirements for use of those other operators.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Replicated operators}  
\label{sec:replicated}

We now consider replicated operators.  We start with external choice.  Below
we write $\Extchoice$ for a semantic operator that takes a set of ALTSs and
builds their external choice.


%% that takes a set $T$ of
%% (process, environment) pairs, and builds the  ALTS corresponding to the
%% external choice over processes $\eval \rho Q$ for $(Q,\rho) \in T$.

%% Consider $P = \M{**[]} stmts \spot Q$.  Let $S = \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts$.
%% Then $\evalStmtsSet (f(\rho))~stmts = f(S)$ by clause \ref{item:evalStmts} of
%% the inductive hypothesis.
%% Hence we have
%% %
%% \begin{eqnarray*}
%% \eval \rho~ P & = &  \Extchoice \set{(Q,\rho') \| \rho' \in S}, \\
%% \eval (f(\rho))~ P & = &   \Extchoice \set{(Q,\rho'') \| \rho'' \in f(S)}. 
%% \end{eqnarray*}

%% We show that $\Extchoice T \bisim_f \Extchoice (f(T))$, which implies
%% $\eval \rho~ P \bisim_f \eval (f(\rho))~ P$.
%% %
%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item
%% Each initial visible transition of $\Extchoice T$ is of the form
%% $(P,\rho) \trans{a}_{T_1} (Q',\rho'')$ such that $(Q,\rho') \trans{a}_{T_1}
%% (Q',\rho'')$ for some $(Q,\rho') \in T$.  By induction, that is matched by a
%% transition $(Q,f(\rho')) \trans{f(a)}_{T_2} (Q',f(\rho''))$.  But
%% $f(\rho') \in f(S)$, so this produces a corresponding transition from
%% $(P,f(\rho))$.

%% \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Consider $P = \M{**[]} stmts \spot Q$.  Let $S = \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts$.
Then $\evalStmtsSet (f(\rho))~stmts = f(S)$ by clause \ref{item:evalStmts} of
the inductive hypothesis.  Hence we have
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eval \rho~ P & = & 
  \Extchoice \set{\eval \rho' ~ Q \| \rho' \in S}, \\
\eval (f(\rho))~ P & = & 
  \Extchoice \set{\eval \rho'' ~ Q \| \rho'' \in f(S)} 
   =  \Extchoice \set{\eval (f(\rho'))~ Q \| \rho' \in S} .
\end{eqnarray*}
%
We show $\eval \rho~ P \bisim_f \eval (f(\rho))~ P$.  By
induction, $\eval \rho' ~ Q \bisim_f \eval (f(\rho'))~ Q$, for each~$\rho'$,
so it is enough to consider transitions up to the resolution of the external
choice. 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Each initial visible transition of $\eval \rho~ P$ is of the form
$(P,\rho) \trans{a}_{T_1} (Q',\rho'')$ such that $(Q,\rho') \trans{a}_{T_1}
(Q',\rho'')$ for some $\rho' \in S$.  By induction, that is matched by a
transition $(Q,f(\rho')) \trans{f(a)}_{T_2} (Q',f(\rho''))$.  But
$f(\rho') \in f(S)$, so this produces a corresponding transition from
$(P,f(\rho))$.

The case for an initial $\tau$-transition of $\eval \rho~ P$ is similar,
except each subsequent state is an external choice where the component
$(Q,\rho')$ is replaced by $(Q',\rho'')$.  The case for transitions from those
subsequent states is similar.

\item
Each initial visible transition of $\eval (f(\rho))~ P$ is of the form
$(P,f(\rho)) \trans{b}_{T_2} (Q',\rho'')$ such that
$(Q,f(\rho')) \trans{b}_{T_2} (Q',\rho'')$ for some $\rho' \in S$.  By
induction, that is matched by a transition $(Q,\rho') \trans{a}_{T_1}
(Q',\rho''')$ such that $f(a) = b$ and $f(\rho''') = \rho''$, which produces a
corresponding transition from~$(P,\rho)$.

Again, the case for an initial $\tau$-transition is similar. 
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% \subsection*{Ignore}

%% We show
%% %
%% \begin{eqnarray*}
%% f(\Extchoice S) & = & \Extchoice \set{f(P) \| P \in S}.

%% %
%% For every $P \in S$, and for every transition $P \trans{e} Q$, the initial

%% \end{calc}

The case for a replicated nondeterministic choice is similar.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Consider now a replicated interleaving $\M{**\|\|\|} ~ stmts ~ \M{@} ~ P$.
% Recall that the indexing statements~$stmts$ are independent of~|T|.
We write $\Interleave$ for a semantic interleaving operator, which takes a
multiset\footnote{We write a multiset as ``$\mset{\ldots}$''.} of processes as
an argument, and interleaves them.  Then
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eval \rho ~(\M{**\|\|\|} ~ stmts ~ \M{@} ~ P) & = & 
  \Interleave \mset{ \eval \rho'~P \| \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts }, \\
\eval (f(\rho))~(\M{**\|\|\|} ~ stmts ~ \M{@} ~ P) & = & 
  \Interleave \mset{ \eval \rho''~P \| 
     \rho'' \in \evalStmtsSet (f(\rho))~stmts } \\
& = & \Interleave \mset{ \eval \rho''~P \| 
    \rho'' \in f(\evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts) }.
\end{eqnarray*}
%
using clause~\ref{item:evalStmts} of the inductive hypothesis.

Recall that the indexing statements~$stmts$ are independent of~|T|.  Suppose
$\evalStmtsSet~\rho~stmts$ includes an environment $\rho \oplus \rho'$ where
$\rho'$ captures the bindings in~$stmts$, and so is independent of~|T|; 
then $f(\rho \oplus \rho') = f(\rho) \oplus \rho'$.  
This means that the sets $\evalStmtsSet~\rho~stmts$ and
$f(\evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts)$ have the same cardinality: the application
of~$f$ does not unify two different bindings corresponding to $stmts$.
Hence we also have
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eval (f(\rho))~(\M{**\|\|\|} ~ stmts ~ \M{@} ~ P) & = & 
   \Interleave \mset{ \eval (f(\rho'))~P \| \rho' \in \evalStmts \rho~stmts }.
\end{eqnarray*}


Now, $\eval \rho'~P \bisim_f \eval (f(\rho'))~P$ for each~$\rho'$, by
induction.  
Hence we have $\eval \rho ~(\M{**\|\|\|} ~ stmts ~ \M{@} ~
P) \bisim_f \eval (f(\rho))~(\M{**\|\|\|} ~ stmts ~ \M{@} ~ P)$, using the
fact that $f$-bisimulation is compositional with respect to binary
interleaving, and the fact that a replicated interleaving can be rewritten
using binary interleaving.

%% multiset\footnote{We write a multiset as ``$\mset{\ldots}$''.} of processes as
%% an argument.  We have that
%% %
%% \begin{eqnarray}
%% \label{eqn:replicated-interleave}
%% f(\Interleave S) & = & \Interleave \mset{f(P) \| P \in S}.
%% \end{eqnarray}
%% %
%% This follows from the corresponding equation $f(P \interleave Q) =
%% f(P) \interleave f(Q)$ for binary interleaving, and the fact that the replicated
%% interleaving can be rewritten using binary interleaving.  It is important here
%% that we are using a \emph{multiset}, so the two sides
%% of~(\ref{eqn:replicated-interleave}) have the same number of processes, even if
%% $f$ unifies two elements of~$S$: this matches the semantics of~\CSPm, which
%% produces a set of environments from $stmts$, and then from each such
%% environment produces a process (possibly with repetitions).

%% Recall that the indexing statements~$stmts$ are independent of~|T|.  Suppose
%% $\evalStmtsSet~\rho~stmts$ includes an environment $\rho \oplus \rho'$ where
%% $\rho'$ captures the bindings in~$stmts$, and so is independent of~$f$; 
%% then $f(\rho \oplus \rho') = f(\rho) \oplus \rho'$.  
%% This means that the sets $\evalStmtsSet~\rho~stmts$ and
%% $f(\evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts)$ have the same cardinality: the application
%% of~$f$ does not unify two different bindings corresponding to $stmts$.

%% We calculate as follows.
%% %
%% \begin{calc}
%% & f(\eval \rho (\M{**\|\|\|} ~ stmts~ \M{@} ~ P)) \\
%% = & f( \Interleave \mset{ \eval \rho' ~ P \|
%%           \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts} ) \\
%% = & \com{equation (\ref{eqn:replicated-interleave})} \\
%% & \Interleave \mset{ f(\eval \rho'~P) \| 
%%      \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts}  \\
%% = & \com{inductive hypothesis} \\
%% & \Interleave \mset{ \eval (f(\rho'))~P \| 
%%     \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts}  \\
%% = & \com{letting $\rho'' = f(\rho')$; above observation about cardinality} \\
%% & \Interleave \mset{ \eval \rho''~P \| 
%%     \rho'' \in f(\evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts)}  \\
%% = & \com{inductive hypothesis, clause~\ref{item:evalStmts}} \\
%% & \Interleave \mset{ \eval \rho''~P \| 
%%     \rho'' \in \evalStmtsSet (f(\rho))~stmts}  \\
%% = & \eval (f(\rho))~(\M{**\|\|\|} ~ stmts~ \M{@}~ P).
%% \end{calc}

%%%%%%%%%%

The cases for other replicated operators are very similar.  Recall that we
assume that each of the alphabets on parallel operators is defined by an
invariant expression, and so evaluates to a $T_1$-invariant set.  In each
case, we can show that $f$-bisimulation is compositional with respect to the
replicated operator because it is compositional with respect to the
corresponding binary operator.  For replicated sequential composition and link
parallel, the statements are evaluated using $\evalStmts$ to produce a
sequence, rather than a set.
