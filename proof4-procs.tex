\subsubsection{Processes}


We now consider process expressions.

\paragraph{Basic processes.} $STOP$, $SKIP$, $div$: these are all trivial.

\paragraph{Non-indexed sequential operators.}

We now consider non-indexed sequential operators, other than renaming.  We
start with external choice.

Below we write $\extchoice$ for a semantic operator: ``${P \extchoice Q}$''
represents an external choice between~$P$ and~$Q$, each of which is an LTS\@.
We show that
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(P \extchoice Q) & = & f(P) \extchoice f(Q).
\end{eqnarray*}
%
For every transition $P \trans{e} P'$, the initial state of each of the above
processes has a transition labelled $f(e)$ to~$f(P')$; and similarly for
transitions of~$Q$.

We then have the following (for syntactic expressions~$P$ and~$Q$):
%
\begin{calc}
& f(\eval \rho ~ (P \; \M{[]} Q) \\
= & f((\eval \rho~P) \extchoice (\eval \rho~Q)) \\
= & \com{above result} \\
& f(\eval \rho~P) \extchoice f(\eval \rho~Q) \\
= & \com{inductive hypothesis} \\
& (\eval (f(\rho))~P) \extchoice (\eval (f(\rho))~Q) \\
= & \eval (f(\rho)) (P \; \M{[]} Q).
\end{calc}

The proofs for the binary operators nondeterministic choice (\CSPM{_ \|~\|
_}), sliding choice (\CSPM{_ [> _}), interrupt (\CSPM{_ /\\ _}), and
sequential composition (\CSPM{_ ; _}) are very similar.

For the exception operator (\CSPM{_ [\| E \|> _}), recall that we assume that
|E| is invariant (item~\ref{item:di-invariant} of
Definition~\ref{defn:data-independent}).  Hence $\eval \rho~E$ is
$T$-invariant, by Lemma~\ref{lem:invariant}.
%  
We write $\_ \throw{A} \_$ for the corresponding semantic operator.  We show
that if $A$ is $T$-invariant then
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(P \throw{A} Q) & = & f(P) \throw{f(A)} f(Q).
\end{eqnarray*}
%
On the left-hand side, every transition of~$P$ on an event from~$A$ is replace
by a transition to the initial state of~$Q$, and then all events are renamed
by~$f$.  On the right-hand side, the events are renamed first, and then every
transition from $f(P)$ on an event from~$f(e) \in f(A)$ is replaced by a
transition to the initial state of~$f(Q)$.  But if $f(e) \in f(A)$ then $e \in
A$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:T-invariant-inclusion}, so there is a corresponding
transition on the left-hand side.  The rest of the proof is then as for
external choice.

For hiding, note that if $A$ is $T$-invariant, then
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(P \hide A) & = & f(P) \hide f(A).
\end{eqnarray*}
%
One the right-hand side, an event $e$ of~$P$ is hidden if $f(e) \in f(A)$; but
then $e \in A$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:T-invariant-inclusion}.  The rest of the
proof is then as for external choice.

A guarded process $g ~\M{\&}~ P$ is equivalent to $\M{if}~ g ~ \M{then}~
P ~ \M{else STOP}$.  The result follows from the result for if-statements.

\paragraph{Binary Parallel operators.}

We now consider the binary parallel operators.  We start with the generalised
parallel operator $\_ \parallel[A] \_$.  Recall that we assume that the
expression defining the synchronisation set is invariant, and hence the value
of that set is $T$-invariant.  

We write $\_ \parallel[A] \_$ for a semantic operator that forms the parallel
composition of LTSs, synchronising on events from~$A$.  Recall that we assume
that the identifiers bound by the two components of the parallel composition
are disjoint; this means that we can restrict a ``global'' environment to the
identifiers of each component, or form the union of the environments of the
two components.  For example, if $(P, \rho_P) \trans{e} (P', \rho_P')$ and
$(Q, \rho_Q) \trans{e} (Q',
\rho_Q')$ with $e \in A$, and $\rho_P$ and~$\rho_Q$ agree on common
identifiers, then $(P \parallel[A] Q, \rho_P \union \rho_Q) \trans{e} (P'
\parallel[A] Q', \rho_P' \union \rho_Q')$: the resulting environments
$\rho_P'$ and $\rho_Q'$ agree on common identifiers, so their union makes
sense.

We show that, assuming $A$ is $T$-invariant:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:parallel-dist}
f((P,\rho_P) \parallel[A] (Q,\rho_Q)) & = & 
  f(P,\rho_P) \parallel[f(A)] f(Q,\rho_Q).
\end{eqnarray}
%
The tricky case is as follows.  Consider a transition of the right-hand side
corresponding to a synchronisation on event~$e \in f(A)$.  This must
correspond to transitions 
\[
(P,\rho_P) \trans{e_P} (P',\rho_P') \quad\mbox{and}\quad
(Q,\rho_Q) \trans{e_Q} (Q',\rho_Q') \quad
\mbox{with}\quad f(e_P) = f(e_Q) = e.
\]
The subsequent state is 
\[
f(P',\rho_P') \parallel[f(A)] f(Q',\rho_Q') = 
  (P',f(\rho_P')) \parallel[f(A)] (Q',f(\rho_Q')).
\]
If $e_P \ne e_Q$, then consider the first field in which they differ; say $e_p
= c.\vec{u}.v_P.\vec{w_P}$ and $e_Q = c.\vec{u}.v_Q.\vec{w_Q}$ with $v_P \ne
v_Q$ but $f(v_P) = f(v_Q)$.
%
Then by item~\ref{item:sync} of Definition~\ref{defn:data-independent}, one of
the processes must be willing to accept an arbitrary value in this position;
without loss of generality, suppose this is~$P$, so $P$ can also perform $e_P'
= c.\vec{u}.v_Q.\vec{w_P}$.  If the transition binds $x$ to this field in
$P$'s environment, then this corresponds to the transition
$(P,\rho_P) \trans{e_P'} (P,\rho_P'')$ where $\rho_P''
= \rho_P' \oplus \set{x \mapsto v_Q}$.  Note that $f(e_P') = e$ and
$f(\rho_P'') = f(\rho_P')$.
%
Continuing in this way, we obtain transitions
\[
\begin{array}{c}
(P,\rho_P) \trans{e'} (P',\hat\rho_P) \quad\mbox{and}\quad
(Q,\rho_Q) \trans{e'} (Q',\hat\rho_Q) \\
\mbox{with}\quad f(e')  = e, \quad 
f(\hat\rho_P) = f(\rho_P'), \quad f(\hat\rho_Q) = f(\rho_Q').
\end{array}
\]
Also, note that $f(e') = e \in f(A)$, so $e' \in A$, by
Lemma~\ref{lem:T-invariant-inclusion}, since $A$ is $T$-invariant.
%
Hence, in the left-hand side of (\ref{eqn:parallel-dist}), the two
components can synchronise on~$e'$, giving a transition on $f(e') = e$, and
producing state 
\[
f( (P',\hat\rho_P) \parallel[A] (Q',\hat\rho_Q) ) .
\]
This matches the original transition of the right-hand side.

Other cases ---that every synchronisation of the left-hand side is matched by
a synchronisation of the right-hand side, and that non-synchronisation
transitions match--- can be proved in a similar but more straightforward way.

The proof then proceeds as for other binary operators.  

The cases of the alphabetised parallel ($\_ \parallel[A][B] \_$) and
interleaving ($\interleave$) operators are similar; recall that for the
former, it is assumed that the expressions that define the alphabets are
invariant, and hence the values of those alphabets are $T$-invariant.

\paragraph{Replicated operators.}

.......

Below we write $\Extchoice$ for a semantic operator: ``$\Extchoice S$''
represents an external choice over the set of processes in~$S$, each of which
is an LTS\@.  We show that
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(\Extchoice S) & = & \Extchoice \set{f(P) \| P \in S}.
\end{eqnarray*}
%
For every $P \in S$, and for every transition $P \trans{e} Q$, the initial
state of each of the above processes has a transition labelled with $f(e)$ to
$f(Q)$.

We then have the following (for syntactic expressions~$S$ and~$P$):
\begin{calc}
& f(\eval \rho~ (\M{**[]} stmts \spot P)) \\
= & f(\Extchoice \set{\eval \rho'~ P \| \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts}) \\
= & \com{above result} \\
  & \Extchoice \set{f(\eval \rho' ~P) \| \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts} \\
= & \com{inductive hypothesis for~$P$} \\
  & \Extchoice \set{\eval (f(\rho'))~P \| 
      \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts} \\
= & \com{letting $\rho'' = f(\rho')$} \\
  & \Extchoice \set{\eval \rho''~P \| 
      \rho'' \in f(\evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts)} \\
= & \com{inductive hypothesis, part \ref{item:evalStmtsSet}} \\
  & \Extchoice \set{\eval \rho''~P \| 
      \rho'' \in \evalStmtsSet (f(\rho))~stmts} \\
= & \eval (f(\rho'))~ (\M{**[]} stmts \spot P).
\end{calc}



The case for a replicated nondeterministic choice is similar.  

Other replicated operators \framebox{**}.  Indexing set independent of $t$. 


Consider now a replicated alphabetised parallel composition $\M{\|\|} ~ stmts
~ \M{@ [} A \M{]}~ P$.  We write $\Parallel$ for a semantic parallel
composition operator, which takes a multiset of (process, alphabet) pairs as an
argument.   We have that
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:indexed-parallel}
f(\Parallel S) & = & \Parallel \set{(f(P), f(A)) \| (P,a) \in S}
\end{eqnarray}
which follows from the corresponding equation $f(P \parallel[A][B] Q) =
f(P) \parallel[f(A)][f(B)] f(Q)$ for binary parallel composition, and the fact
that the indexed parallel composition can be rewritten using binary parallel
composition (it is important here that we are using a \emph{multiset}, so the
two sides of~(\ref{eqn:indexed-parallel}) have the same number of processes.


Recall that the indexing statements~$stmt$ are independent of~$t$.  Hence
$\evalStmts~\rho~stmts$ and $\evalStmts~(f(\rho))~stmts =
f(\evalStmts \rho~stmts)$ have the same cardinality (recall that each is a
multiset of environments).  \framebox{???????}

\begin{calc}
& f(\eval \rho (\M{\|\|} ~ stmts~ \M{@ [} A \M{]}~ P)) \\
= & f( \Parallel \set{ (\eval \rho' ~ P, \eval \rho'~ A) \| 
       \rho' \in \evalStmts \rho~stmts} ) \\
= & \com{equation (\ref{eqn:indexed-parallel})} \\
& \Parallel \set{ (f(\eval \rho'~P), f(\eval \rho'~A)) \| 
     \rho' \in \evalStmts \rho~stmts}  \\
