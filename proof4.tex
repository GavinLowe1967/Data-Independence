\subsection{Expressions}

We show that for every expression~$e$ in the script,
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(\eval \rho ~ e) & = & \eval (f(\rho)) e .
\end{eqnarray*}

We structure the proof as follows.  We start with non-process expressions.  In
Section~\ref{sec:atomic} we consider atomic values.  In
Section~\ref{sec:tuples} we consider tuples and dotted tuples.  In
Section~\ref{sec:structural} we consider structural operators (local
definitions and |if| statements).  In Section~\ref{sssec:function-decl} we
consider functions: function applications, functions defined as lambda
abstractions, functions bound to names, and built-in functions (restricted as
in item~\ref{item:built-in-functions} of
Definition~\ref{defn:data-independent}); we also show that each such function
respects~$f$.  In Section~\ref{sec:collections} we consider collections: sets,
sequences and maps.

We then move on to process expressions.  Recall that we show 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\eval \rho ~ P & \bisim_f & \eval (f(\rho)) ~P
\end{eqnarray*}
%
for each process expression~$P$, which implies $f(\eval \rho ~ P) = \eval
(f(\rho)) P$.  Note that clause~3 of Definition~\ref{def:f-bisim} holds
immediately: the two initial states are $(P,\rho)$ and $(P,f(\rho))$,
respectively; our proofs concentrate on showing that the transitions match.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:basic-procs} we consider basic processes, and in
Section~\ref{sec:prefixing} we consider the prefixing construct.  In
Section~\ref{sec:sequential-procs} we consider non-replicated sequential
operators; in Section~\ref{sec:parallel} we consider non-replicated parallel
operators; and in Section~\ref{sec:replicated} we consider replicated
operators.

\subsubsection{Atomic values}
\label{sec:atomic}

\paragraph{Names.}

Consider a name~$x$ bound by the environment, other than a datatype
constructor or channel name (but including the name of a type).  Then
\[
f(\eval \rho~x) = f(\rho~x) = \eval (f(\rho))~x.
\]

Now consider the name~$d$ of a datatype constructor (so both $\rho$ and
$f(\rho)$ map $c$ to a $\dtcons$ value).  Necessarily, $d$ is not a member
of~|T|, given our assumption about values from~|T| not appearing in the
script.  Note that $d$ evaluates to itself, regardless of the environment.
Hence
\[
f(\eval \rho~d) = f(d) = d = \eval (f(\rho))~d.
\]
Note that the middle step would fail to hold for a member of~|T|: this
justifies our assumption about such values not appearing in the script. 
%
The case of the name of a channel is identical. 

%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Basic values.}

For a basic value~$v$ (an integer, boolean, character or string):
\[
f(\eval \rho~v) = f(v) = v = \eval(f(\rho))~v,
\]
since $v$ is independent of~|T|.

\subsubsection{Composite values}
\label{sec:tuples}

Consider a dotted pair $e_1 . e_2$.
%
\begin{calc}
& f(\eval \rho ~(e_1.e_2)) \\
 = & f(\eval \rho~e_1. \eval \rho~e_2) \\
 = & f(\eval \rho~e_1) . f(\eval \rho~e_2) \\
 = & \com{inductive hypothesis} \\
  & \eval (f(\rho))~e_1 . \eval (f(\rho))~e_2 \\
 = & \eval (f(\rho)) (e_1.e_2).
\end{calc}

The case for tuples is very similar.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Structural operators}
\label{sec:structural}

The case for local declarations is as follows.
%
\begin{calc}
& f(\eval \rho~(\M{let}~decls~\M{within}~e)) \\
= & f(\Let \rho' = \bindDecls \rho~decls \In \eval \rho'~e) \\
= & \Let \rho' = \bindDecls \rho~decls \In f(\eval \rho'~e) \\
= & \com{inductive hypothesis} \\
 &  \Let \rho' = \bindDecls \rho~decls \In \eval (f(\rho'))~e \\
= & \com{letting $\rho'' = f(\rho')$} \\
& \Let \rho'' = f (\bindDecls \rho~decls) \In \eval \rho''~e \\
= & \com{inductive hypothesis, clause~\ref{item:bindDecls}} \\
& \Let \rho'' = \bindDecls (f(\rho))~decls \In \eval \rho''~e \\
= & \eval (f(\rho))~(\M{let}~decls~\M{within}~e).
\end{calc}

The case for |if| statements is as follows.
%
\begin{calc}
& f(\eval \rho~(\M{if}~b~\M{then}~e_1~\M{else}~e_2)) \\
= & f(\If \eval \rho~b \Then \eval \rho~e_1 \Else \eval \rho~e_2) \\
= & \com{boolean values are invariant under~$f$} \\
 & \If f(\eval \rho~b) \Then f(\eval \rho~e_1) \Else f(\eval \rho~e_2) \\
= & \com{inductive hypothesis} \\
 & \If \eval~(f(\rho))~b \Then \eval (f(\rho))~e_1) 
    \Else \eval(f(\rho))~e_2 \\
= & \eval (f(\rho)) (\M{if}~b~\M{then}~e_1~\M{else}~e_2).
\end{calc}

\subsubsection{Collections}
\label{sec:collections}

We now consider collections: sets, sequences and maps.  Various functions that
operate over such collections were considered in
Section~\ref{sssec:function-decl}: here we consider direct methods of defining
collections.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item
Case of a set comprehension. Below, the set comprehensions in the first and
last line are syntax, and the other set comprehensions are semantics. 
% 
\begin{calc}
& f(\eval \rho ~ \set{ e \| stmts }) \\
= & f(\set{ \eval \rho'~e \| \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts }) \\
= & \set{ f(\eval \rho'~e) \| \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts } \\
= & \com{inductive hypothesis} \\
  & \set{ \eval (f(\rho'))~e) \| \rho' \in \evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts } \\
= & \com{letting $\rho'' = f(\rho')$} \\ 
  & \set{ \eval \rho''~e) \| \rho'' \in f(\evalStmtsSet \rho~stmts) } \\
= & \com{clause \ref{item:evalStmts}} \\
  & \set{ \eval \rho''~e) \| \rho'' \in \evalStmtsSet (f(\rho))~stmts } \\
= & \eval (f(\rho)) ~ \set{e \| stmts}.
\end{calc}

\item The case for  a sequence comprehension $\M{<}\, e \| stmts \,\M{>}$ is
very similar to that for a set comprehension, except $stmts$ are evaluated
using $\evalStmts$, which produces a sequence of environments.

\item The cases for a set $\{e_1, \ldots, e_n\}$, ranged integer set
$\set{e .. e'}$ (where $e$ and~$e'$ evaluate to integers), infinite integer
set $\set{ e .. }$, sequence $\M{<} e_1, \ldots, e_n \M{>}$, ranged integer
sequence $\M< e .. e' \M>$, and infinite integer equence $\M< e .. \M>$, are
straightforward.

\item The cases for extensions sets $\M{\{\|}\, e \| stmts \M{\|\}}$ and
$\M{\{\|}\, e_1, \ldots, e_n \M{\|\}}$ follow from the cases for sets, since
each could be replaced by a set expression, with extra generators for the
``missing'' fields (cf.~the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:invariant}).

\item The case for a map $(\| k_1 => v_1, ..., k_n => v_n \|)$ is also
straightforward: recall that the domain type of a map must be independent
of~|T|, so each~$k_i$ evaluates to a value that is invariant under~$f$. 

\item
For the name |Events|, representing the set of all events, the case is as
follows; note that for a channel name~$c$,\, $f(c) = c$. 
%
\begin{calc}
& f(\eval \rho ~\M{Events}) \\
= & f(\set{ c.v \| c \mapsto \channel S \in \rho,\, v \in S }) \\
= & \set{ c.f(v) \| c \mapsto \channel S \in \rho,\, v \in S }) \\
= & \com{letting $v' = f(v)$} \\
 & \set{ c.v' \| c \mapsto \channel S \in \rho,\, v' \in f(S) }) \\
= & \com{letting  $s' = f(S)$} \\
 & \set{ c.v' \| c \mapsto \channel S' \in f(\rho),\, v' \in S' }) \\
= & \eval (f(\rho)) ~\M{Events}.
\end{calc}
\end{itemize}
